Technomancy Changelog

v2.6.0:
When adventuring, you have less of a chance of finding a logikitten now. In terminus, the freezing noncombat is less likely. Fixed a bug with upgrades that give buildings potentially giving none. Logikittens now say what rewards you got. 

v2.5.1:
Logikittens don't give energy/mana/similar. 

v2.5.0:
Added new adventure mode location. Umbra has a new adventure that expands ship storage. Your first event after reload appears sooner if you have the upgrade that does it. You can find cute kittens while you're there and they give rewards for solving puzzles.

v2.4.1:
Umbra encounter now doesn't let you get NaN fuel, re-adventuring in a place should turn red if you don't have enough fuel. 

v2.4.0:
New umbra encounter (throw some stuff away), oil well upgrades no longer check production of oil wells, mana gain power reduced (but not as much as raised, so still a bit higher), embezzling gives more stuff (may still not be enough, but yay uranium!), eregs boosts oil wells. Also started work on new event, use force_event(10) in the console to try it out (not interactive yet, but it's coming soon, unlocked by adventure mode!)

v2.3.2:
Mana is slightly easier to get. Time now is used up faster. You can see a few mana buildings ahead maybe. Factory is once again at 50 mana.

v2.3.1:
Investments should have proper sigfigs, bribing a politician shows up earlier and tells you that you need banks. Trade portal tells you that unused mana helps it, time rewind no longer has an inaccurate tooltip.

v2.3.0:
New location: Umbra. Also there's a mysterious warpgate. Also adventuring should be less laggy. 

v2.2.3:
Tooltips now have the proper background color, positive resources will now not be red. 

v2.2.2:
Shield images now have transparent background. Light theme secondary color is lighter. Workshop menu changes with theme.

v2.2.1:
Ice giant should be more common. Hydrogen mines should build one, not 2 and give proper /s generation. You can now switch from the dark theme to an even worse light theme.

v2.2.0:
Changelog renamed (Technomancy instead of Crappy Incremental). Add new hopefully not broken ice giant encounter. Unbuyable buildings now say so.

v2.1.1:
You can now actually get hydrogen from the moon encounter (bug fixed), gold sifters use less stone, printing press upgrade text is fixed, resources with negative values use the positive version in prestige.

v2.1.0:
You can now buy iron ore at Cath. Add two library upgrades. Destroying buildings refunds 30% of the build cost. Setting to buy multiple actually updates tooltops properly. Removing fuel says "Remove" instead of "Add". You can make machine parts and build mines on the moon. Making more small lasers is now harder and equally useless.

v2.0.1:
Space squid rewards you on killing it. It has a slightly different AI now too. Also winning/losing fights is better. 

v2.0.0:
Adventure mode! A total of 4 locations available to explore! A dazzling space squid to fight! Also a boring bugfix with fuel generation. 

v1.18.2:
Nothing shows in the /s area if you're getting 0/s, if it's negative it shows up red. 

v1.18.1:
Add upgrade for more common events. Investments now gain much more money. Artifacts give more refined mana but it decreases over time. Demons give you more stuff. Workshop bar now changes color depending on if it is working or not.

v1.18.0:
Time rewind costs more mana. Added upgrade to make time rewind cheaper. Reduced bribing mana cost back to what it was. Uranium upgrades now take having 200 mana to show up.

v1.17.2:
Coal mines now no longe take more coal than you can initially see them with.

v1.17.1:
Fuel making now takes even more research.

v1.17.0:
Politician bribing is harder. Lots of balance changes: factory takes 75 mana, mines and logging camps are slightly more expensive, furnaces cost more money, gold sifters cost more, oil wells cost more stone and produce less oil, book printers cost more, most end-game buildings have cost increases along with virtually every upgrade. Added oil well upgrades. Mana division rate is harsher.

v1.16.1:
Added notification to export.

v1.16.0:
New wiki link added, solar panel added.

v1.15.9:

v1.15.8:
Doubled mana value, titles change 10x less often.

v1.15.7:
Removed link to the wiki. It was horribly out of date.

v1.15.6:
Bugfixes: Time speed turns off visibly when you run out of time. You can't spam click mana buildings to use them. You can't force an event when you have one. Energy converter is clearer about costs.

v1.15.5:

Fuel maker now uses refined mana as it should.

v1.13.0:
You can now use uranium to make fuel! Mana refinery moved to above greed as it can cost less. Workshop renamed to Manufacturing. Mana now caps trades much quicker. With both upgrades, you can still get steel beams. You need a ton of mana to bribe politicians.

v1.12.0:
Event box is now more annoying (it scrolls with you). Nuclear reactor added. Steel is worth more. Added uranium for your reactors. Trading portal upgrades are more expensive. Total upgrades no longer show. Slight prestige formula fix.

v1.11.0:
Go bribe some politicians now. It can do things.

v1.10.2:
Energy boost starts at a default of 1 instead of 2. Logging camp upgrade takes >= 5 mana instead of > 5. Bank upgrade takes >= 20 instead of > 20. You can actually gain more than 6 mana (reduction of >50 gains were mistakenly applied too early.) Rickrolling autoplays once per prestige now.

v1.10.1:
